# Helpful variables and functions

## 2D

### `TEXTURE`: the texture object (i.e. our Wu Tsai image);
- Can sample (get) a pixel from it by using the function: `texture(TEXTURE, vec2)`, where vec2 is a vector with 2 components in the range `[0, 1]`.


### `UV`: a vec2 representing which pixel is being shaded right now
- It has 2 components x, y representing in the range `[0, 1]`.
- The UV sweeps all values from vec2(0, 0) (the top left corner of our image) to vec2(1, 1) (the bottom right corner of our image).


### `COLOR`: vec4 representing our output color
- In other words, it is the resulting color of the pixel currently being shaded


## 3D

### `ALBEDO`: the equivalent of COLOR in a 3D environment
- The type of ALBEDO is vec3 rather than vec4 like `COLOR`
- The alpha is stored separately in another variable called `ALPHA`.
  - We'll see why this is needed in a later club meeting.

### `NORMAL_MAP`: output variable
- We will use this to make the renderer use our custom normal map texture for the water shader.

## Other

### `TIME`: float representing the number of seconds since Godot has started
- useful for animating shader properties over time

### `sin`, `cos`, `pow` ... your bog-standard math functions
